                The Product Definition Center (PDC) is a new app we're working
                on which will track 1) all of the artifacts that release
                engineering *should* be producing and 2) all of the artifacts
                taht release engineering *did* produce.  The web interface isn't
                much to write home about, but the API is where it's at.

                 authenticate users agains FAS. It is seperate from FAS. The
                 only service that is not using this currently is the wiki.
