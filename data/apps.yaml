                DataGrepper is an HTTP API for querying the datanommer
                database.  You can use it to dig into the history of the
                <a href="http://fedmsg.com">fedmsg</a> message bus.  You
                can grab events by username, by package, by message
                source, by topic... you name it.

                Sometimes the Fedora Infrastructure team messes up (or
                lightning strikes our datacenter(s)).  Sorry about that.
                You can use this website to check the status.  Is it
                "down for everyone, or just me?"<br/>Notice the favicon
                in your browser tab.  It changes based on the status,
                so if you keep this open you can check back to it at a
                glance.

                Fedora is distributed to millions of systems globally.
                This would not be possible without the donations of time,
                disk space, and bandwidth by hundreds of volunteer system
                administrators and their companies or institutions.  Your
                fast download experience is made possible by these
                donations.  The list on the <strong>MirrorManager</strong>
                site is dynamically generated every hour, listing only
                up-to-date mirrors.

                "Is telia down?"  The answer can most definitively be
                found here (and in detail).  The Fedora Infrastructure
                team uses Nagios to monitor the servers that serve
                Fedora.  Accessing most details requires membership
                in the <em>sysadmin</em> group.

                The Product Definition Center (PDC) is a new app we're working
                on which will track 1) all of the artifacts that release
                engineering *should* be producing and 2) all of the artifacts
                taht release engineering *did* produce.  The web interface isn't
                much to write home about, but the API is where it's at.

                It is a web service that is presented via httpd and is load
                balanced by our standard haproxy setup.
